Notes:- Redux WOrks in the Data Layer in React.

    Notes:-We can not Modify the Cart Directly in Redux.
        So, Here is the Way to Modify the Cart .
    ğŸ’ When i Click the Add Button 
        -->
        ğŸ’ It's Dispatch an Action 
            -->
            ğŸ’ That's Action Calls a Function which is (Reducer) and this Function Internally Modify the Cart, which updates the Slice Store
              |                          
             So, this is How we write the data from add button to Cart Slice... 
    Now:- How we can get the data or read the data from the Cart Slice Store and Display it to the Header Cart Oprion [ğŸ›’]..?

    ğŸ’ Now we will use Selector frunction to get the data from the Cart Slice Store and Display it to the Header Cart Option [ğŸ›’].(When we use Selector Method the phenomina is Known as Subscribing to the Sotre --> Subscribing to the store Means it's Sync with the Cart Slice Store with the Page...That means when we change anything the State will update automatically )
    --> ğŸ›’



ğŸ’¥What i have Learned ?

    ğŸ’ 


    âšœ1st- Create a new File as > appStore (import configutreStore from reduxjs-toolkit )

    âšœ2nd - Wrap up everything or  the whole application into Provider which is imported from react-redux and it takes store={} as Prop and inside this store we have to pass {appStore} component.
    
    âšœ3rd - Let's Create a cartSlice --> import createSlice from redux-toolkit and and this createSlice function take some configuration to create a Slice 
        ex:-{
            name : "Slice
        }

What is the difference between this 3 onClick Event.

onClick={()=>handleClick(argument)}
onClick={handleClick(argument)}
onClick={handleClick()}
