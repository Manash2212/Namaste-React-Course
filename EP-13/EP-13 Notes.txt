ğŸ”° Episodes - 11 .....Time for Testing ....


   ğŸ”°Part-1

    ğŸ”†What are the different type of testing that developer can do?
     ans:- 
      1.Manual Testing :- Where we can each and every component in our application.
      The Drawbacks of Manual Testing is - If small changes are made, that will impact the in our whole application. 

      2. Developer write the Test cases for the Testing.

    ğŸ”†What are the Different type of testCases that we can do in our React Application ?
     ans :- Ther are three types of testing that we can do(Write the Test Cases) in our React Application.

        - Unit Testing
        - Intigration Testing
        - End to end testing - e2e testing

    ğŸ”†What is Unit Testing?
     ans:- Unit testing involves, testing indivisual components or function in isolation to ensure they work as expected. In React we can use testing libraries like "Jest" and testing utilities like "React Testing Libraries or Enzyme" to write test cases for components. 

    ğŸ”†What is Intigration Testing?
     ans:- Intigration testing focuses on how different components and modules interact each other.It ensure that various parts of our application are functions correctly.
     
    ğŸ”†What is End to end testing - (or) e2e testing?
     ans :- End-to-end testing is a comprehensive approach that examines an application's functionality from start to finish, this Type of testing allows us to caches bugs and Regressions that might be absent during "Unit Testing" and "Intigration testing".

     There are Popular Framework to write End-to-end test cases, Like:- Cypress, Puppeteer, and Playwright.  

   ğŸ”°Part-2
    
    React testing Library using Jest framework behind the scenes
    So, we need React Testing library and as well as jest in our project

    ğŸ”†Steps- to Set up Testing in our app 
        - Install React Testing library
        - Install Jest Framework
        - Install Babel Dependences
        - Create a new babel.config.js file in root directory
        - configure Babel to target current version of Node by creating babel.config.js.
        - Create a.parcelrc File 
        - Configure the .parcelrc file to disable the default babel transpilation.
        - Jest configuration 
            -> npx jest --init , at the run time it will ask some question to configure the jest and it will create a new configuration file as (jest.config.js)
        - In Testing Library Documentation jest says - If we are using jest 28 or latest, now must be installed separately "jest-environment-jsdom" package.
          ->Install - npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom.
        - Install @babel/preset-react -> to make JSX work in test cases.
        - Include @babel/preset-react inside my babel.config.js file 
          -> Like this - ["@babel/preset-react", { runtime: "automatic" }],
        - Install npm i -D @testing-library/jest-dom (which is used for toBeInTheDocument() )



    What is Babel ? 
     ans :- Bable is a Transpiler

   ğŸ”·Note:- In your command prompt run npm test-(which is jest)
     - If No test found, existing with code 1
     that means we have successfully configured - React Testing Library, jest, Babel, Parcel.

    ğŸ”†What is JSDOM?
     ans:- JSDOM is a library which parces and interact with assembled HTML just like a Browser 
      The benefits is that it itn't actually a browser. Insted, it implements web standards like browsers do.
      npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom

    ğŸ”† "__test__" what is called this Underscore  before and after this test ?  
     ans :- Thi is Called Dunder Method


  ğŸ”°Part-3

    ğŸ’ Notes:- When you console.log on test cases, we will get the jsx from console.log.

    ğŸ”†What is JSX?
     ans:- jsx is nothing but a React Element, React Element is a set of Object.

    ğŸ”†When to use getBy...! and getAllBy...! ?
     ans :- when we need to find single argument in the Document then we use getBy.. Ex - getByRole()
         when we need to find Multiple argument in the Document then we use getAllBy.. Ex - getAllByRole()

  ğŸ’ Simple Rule of Testing of Everytime.
   ans :- 

    test("should Contact us page loadig or not..!", () => {
      -->render Something
          render(<Contactus />);

      -->Querying Something
          const button = screen.getByText("Submit");

      -->Assertion or Assert Somthing
           expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();

    ğŸ”°Part-4

    ğŸ”†What is describe() in test Cases?
     ans :- Suppose in the test file there are lot's of test cases, that becomes difficult to manage. So to Manage the lot's of test cases simultaneously, securely we use describe() to group up the test cases, 
     basically we group the Multiple test cases in a single Block and the Block of the test cases is called describe().
     Example :-
       describe("First Testing in Contact Us Page", () => {
          test("should Contact us page loadig or not..!", () => {
            // render Something
            render(<Contactus />);
        
            // Querying Something
            const button = screen.getByText("Submit");
        
            // Assertion or Assert Somthing
            expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
        
            //toBeInTheDocument()-> THis is function will findout whether my heading is inside the documnet or not! which is rendering.
          });
        
          test("Should check there is any heading Present or Not..!", () => {
            render(<Contactus />);
        
            const heading = screen.getByRole("heading");
        
            // Assertion
        
            expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument();
          });
        
          test("Should check there is Submit text written in the Document", () => {
            render(<Contactus />);
        
            const checkSubmit = screen.getByText("Submit");
        
            expect(checkSubmit).toBeInTheDocument();
          });
        });

    Note:- in Jest, we use "test" as function name and also we can use "it" also.  
        
        Example -
        
        i) test("This is test function",()=>{
          //Rendering
          //Querying
          //Assertion
        })

         and

        ii) it("This is it function",()=>{
          //Rendering
          //Querying
          // Assertion
        })

        ğŸ’¥Till Now that was Unit Testing.

    ğŸ”°Part-5

  ğŸ”†test("Should render Header component with a Login Button .. ", () => {
      render(
        <Provider store={appStore}>
          <BrowserRouter>
            <Header />
          </BrowserRouter>
        </Provider>
      );
      const loginButton = screen.getByRole("button");
      
      ğŸ’ or

      const loginButton = screen.getByText("Login");

      ğŸ’  Assertion
      expect(loginButton).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

  ğŸ”†test("Should render Header component with a Button and the button name is exactly Login.. ", () => {
      render(
        <Provider store={appStore}>
          <BrowserRouter>
            <Header />
          </BrowserRouter>
        </Provider>
      );
      
      const loginButton = screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Login" });
      ğŸ’ Note:- If that component has Multiple button and we want to search some Specific Button,then rules is
       Searh the Button ROle and Pass and Extra Parameters also, like:- {name: "Login"}

      ğŸ’ Assertion
      expect(loginButton).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

  ğŸ”†test("Should render Header component with a Cart items 0.. ", () => {
      render(
        <Provider store={appStore}>
          <BrowserRouter>
            <Header />
          </BrowserRouter>
        </Provider>
      );

      const cartItems = screen.getByText(/0/);

      ğŸ’   Note :- above this is Call rejex is a sequence of character that define a search pattern, it can used to search, edit or manipulate the text and data.

     //Assertion
      expect(cartItems).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

  ğŸ”†test("Should render Header component, and should change the Login button to Logout in oneclick ", () => {
      render(
        <Provider store={appStore}>
          <BrowserRouter>
            <Header />
          </BrowserRouter>
        </Provider>
      );

      const loginButton = screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Login" });

      fireEvent.click(loginButton);

      const logoutEvent = screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Logout" });

      //Assertion
      expect(logoutEvent).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

    ğŸ’ Note :- Jest only can understand react and jsx. jest can not understand redux-toolkit, react-router-dom

  ğŸ”°Part-6

  ğŸ”†How to pass props in test cases to check the particular name are present or not..!
   ans :- as step wise goes but the main thing is we have to pass the "MOCK_DATA" at the Props value

   ğŸ”†Steps to create mock data

    - Create a separate folder name mocks
    - In that mocks folder, we will be storing the mock data, as json format.

  ğŸ’«Example :- 
        
        import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
        import RestaurentCard from "../RestaurentCard";
        import MOCK_DATA from "../mocks/resCardMock.json";
        import "@testing-library/jest-dom";

        test("Should render Restaurent Card Component with props Data", () => {
          render(<RestaurentCard resData={MOCK_DATA} />);

          const name = screen.getByText("Food Peddler Sandwiches");

          //   Assertion
          expect(name).toBeInTheDocument();
        });




  ğŸ”°Part-7
   
   ğŸ”†How to run test cases on automatic after every time when i save my file.
   ğŸ”·Note :- 
        1st - Write in script section in package.json file

        2nd - "watch-test" : "jest --watch", //after that save it 

        3rd - In terminal run --> npm run --watch

        4th - after every save the test cases run automatically.



    ğŸ”†Integration testing on Body component.

     ans :- Step-1

    ğŸ’«Example :-

        import Body from "../Body";
        import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
        import MOCK_DATA from "../mocks/mockResListData.json";

        global.fetch = jest.fn(() => {
          return Promise.resolve({
            json: () => {
              return Promise.resolve(MOCK_DATA); //Here we are passing a mock data .
            },
          });
        });

          i) fetch as same as we fatching data..
          ii) and the jest.fn function is also returned Promise as we returning bellow.
          iii) Promise resolved with a Json
          iv)json again a function that also returns a promise.resolved. and we have to pass the MOCK_DATA.
          
        test("Should render the Body Component", () => {
          render(<Body />);
        });

    Step-2

    - after run the test command, we will get an warning message,
    - that,When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...)
    - the act function  basically comes from -> "react-dom/test-utils"
    - act(()=>{....render()})  
    - the act function returns a promise
    
    ğŸ’«Example :-

        import Body from "../Body";
        import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
        import MOCK_DATA from "../mocks/mockResListData.json";
        import {BrowserRouter} from "react-router-dom";

        global.fetch = jest.fn(() => {
          return Promise.resolve({
            json: () => {
              return Promise.resolve(MOCK_DATA); //Here we are passing a mock data .
            },
          });
        });

          i) fetch as same as we fatching data..
          ii) and the jest.fn function is also returned Promise as we returning bellow.
          iii) Promise resolved with a Json
          iv)json again a function that also returns a promise.resolved. and we have to pass the MOCK_DATA.
          
        test("Should render the Body Component", async () => {
          await act( async()=>{
              <BrowserRouter>
              <Body/>
              </BrowserRouter>
          })
        });

    ğŸ”†Search Restaurent List for.. search input..

     ans:- 
     
     ğŸ”·Note -
        - 1st, we have to fetch TestId for of the Input box Component and RestaurentCard. 
        - 2nd, In input box and RestaurentCard component we have to provide an test id.
        - Example :- data-testid= "searchId" for Input Box and  data-testid= "searchId" for RestaurentCard.  


      ğŸ’«Example:- 
        global.fetch = jest.fn(() => {
          return Promise.resolve({
            json: () => {
              return Promise.resolve(MOCK_DATA); //Here we are passing a mock data .
            },
          });
        });

        test("Should search Restaurent List for ... Search input", async () => {
          await act(async () =>
            render(
              <BrowserRouter>
                <Body />
              </BrowserRouter>
            )
          );

          const cardsBeforeSearch = screen.getAllByTestId("resCard");
          expect(cardsBeforeSearch.length).toBe(9);

          const searchBtn = screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Search" });

          const searchdInput = screen.getByTestId("searchInput");

          fireEvent.change(searchdInput, { target: { value: "pizza" } });

          fireEvent.click(searchBtn);

          const cardsAfterSearch = screen.getAllByTestId("resCard");

          expect(cardsAfterSearch.length).toBe(2);
        });

    ğŸ”†Filterd Toprated Restaurent List after Clicking Toprated Restaurent Button

     and:- 

      ğŸ”·Note:- 

       
    ğŸ’«Example:- 
             
      it("Should Filterd Toprated Restaurent List after Clicking Toprated Restaurent Button", async () => {
        await act(async () =>
          render(
            <BrowserRouter>
              <Body />
            </BrowserRouter>
          )
        );
      
        const cardsBeforeSearch = screen.getAllByTestId("resCard");
        expect(cardsBeforeSearch.length).toBe(9);
      
        const topRatedBtn = screen.getByRole("button", {
          name: "TopRated Restaurent",
        });
      
        fireEvent.click(topRatedBtn);
      
        const cardsAfterFilter = screen.getAllByTestId("resCard");
        expect(cardsAfterFilter.length).toBe(5);
      });

  ğŸ”°Part-9

    ğŸ”†Some Fetures of function Provided by jest which can be used in 

      # In describe function we can Provide 4 types of function.

      1 - beforeAll
      2 - beforeEach
      3 - afterAll
      4 - afterEach

      ğŸ’«Example :- 

       describe("First Testing in Contact Us Page", () => {

       - beforeAll(() => {
          console.log("Calling Before All test");
        });

       - beforeEach(() => {
          console.log("ğŸ’¥Calling Before Each test");
        });

       - afterAll(() => {
          console.log("ğŸ’¦Calling After All test");
        });

       - afterEach(() => {
          console.log("ğŸ’šCalling After Each test");
        });




     

        




ğŸ’¥What i have Learned ?

    ğŸ’ 


    âšœ1st- Create a new File as > appStore (import configutreStore from reduxjs-toolkit )

    âšœ2nd - Wrap up everything or  the whole application into Provider which is imported from react-redux and it takes store={} as Prop and inside this store we have to pass {appStore} component.
    
    âšœ3rd - Let's Create a cartSlice --> import createSlice from redux-toolkit and and this createSlice function take some configuration to create a Slice 
        ex:-{
            name : "Slice
        }

What is the difference between this 3 onClick Event.

onClick={()=>handleClick(argument)}
onClick={handleClick(argument)}
onClick={handleClick()}

   ğŸ’«Redux Toolkit
     -Install @reduxjs-toolkit and react-redux
     -Build Our store
     -Connect Our Store to our app
     -Slice (cartSlice)
     -Dispatch(Action)
     -Selector
