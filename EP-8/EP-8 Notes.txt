    ğŸ”†What is componentDidMount, and why do we use it? 
     ans :- ğŸ”·ComponentDidMount is use For API call.
    ğŸ”·The componentDidMount is a Lifecycle method of React, it is called once the component has been mounted to the DOM, it is typically used for any necessary API Calls or data fetching.

    ğŸ”†What is componentWillUnmount, and why do we use it?
     ans :- When ever the page shifted another page, like- when we click to another page at that time componentWillUnmount is called, and also componentWillUnmount only called when ever i shifted that page to another page. 
    
    ğŸ”†How React Lifecycle Methods are work?
     ans :- (i.)Whenever the in class based component class loads after that Everything Start Let's start

      ------Mounting Lifecycle------ is Called
     --->1st: Constructor is called with (Dummy Data).
     --->2nd: Render is called with that (Dummy Data). 
                and <Display the Dummy HTML Data to the Web pages> 
     --->3rd: Now componentDidMount will called. 
          In componentDidMount...<API will called>
          then <this.setState()> is Called-->with new API data where state Variable is Updated

      -------Updating Cycle----- is Called
     --->4th: When Updating Cycle is Start 
          render is called with New <API Data>....Here DOM reconsiliation is started
          after that updated <HTML (new API Data)> in the web Page...
          then componentDidUpdate() is called



    ğŸ”†Parent and Child RealationShip in Class Based Component.
     ans: - First Parent Constructor is called 
          - then  Parent Render is called
             - then Child Constructor is called
             - then Child Render is called --> When the Whole Component is Mounted Successfully
             - then in Child componentDidMount is called --> once the Child ComponentDidMounted Successfully
          - after that Parent componentDidMount is Called.

    ğŸ”†Why we should use initial valu?
     and:- suppose we fethcing an API, during the fetching time react loads the initial value to the webpage for some milliseconds, after that componentDidMount or useEffect is called the render happens again and then the fetch API data is Load.

 ğŸ”· Note: useEffect and componentDidMount is not same at all.
 ğŸ”· Note: When ever we use setInterval to any component then we should clear it as well, other wise the browser Cache will increased and  
            website will get Hanged.
