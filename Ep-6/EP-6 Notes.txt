🔆 What is a Microservice?
 ans :- Microservice architecture treats each function of an application as an independent service that can be alerted, Updated, or taken down without affecting rest of the application. 

  💫Benifits :- 
     1)Better deploybility 
     2)Comfortable for developer to understand
     3)Better code Readability.
     4)The application start faster.

  💫Drawbacks :- 
     1)Testing more Difficult acording to Monolith architecture.
     2)Developer must deal with the additional complexity of creating a distributed system.

🔆 What is Monolith architecture?
 ans:- Monolith means composed all in one piece. A Monolith application describe a single-tired software application in which different components combined in to a single program from a single platform.

  There is a Very famous quots is "Never Put all egs in one Busket" and Monolith does exact oposite things. 
 Mono means : Single , and Lithc means : Stone
 
  💫Benifits :- 
     1)Simple to develop, 
     2)Simple to test, 
     3)Simple to deploy.

  💫Drawbacks :-
     1) Maintenance - If application to Large and complex to understand, then it will be chalenging to make changes fast and correctly.
     2)The Size of the application can slow down the Start-up time.
     3)On each update we have to Re-deploy the application.
     4)Continuously Deployment is Difficult.

🔆 Why do we need a useEffect Hook?
 ans :- The React useState hook is used to manage and handle the state.
  States are mutable, which means their value can change.
  The useState hooks allows you to create, track and update a state in a functional component. 

🔆 What is Optional Chaining?
 ans :- The Optional Chaining operator (?.) is like a shortcut of accessing nested properties in a series of object.
  If the property exists, the operator will return the value of the property. If the property does not exist, the operator will return undefined insted of throwing error.

🔆 What is Shimmer UI?
 ans :- So suppose we build a web app with ReactJS for displaying the data we follow this process:
    
    Page Loads --> Render--> API call --> Render

 We have to render before the API calls , suppose API call is taking 500ms so for better UX we have to make sure before that otherwise it will fill like the site has stuck.

 So the in Secound Render stage, as a Regullar process we put Loading icon at the loading Phase, but here comes the part of Shimmer UI. When the site is loading it gives some fake empty cards(Which is castomizable ) and then dipslay the data After API calls. 


🔆 What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement
 ans :-

🔆 What is Conditional Rendering, explain with a code example
 ans :- In React, Conditional Rendaring is a process of displaying different content based on different condition or states. It allows to creates dynamic user interface.

  Example :- 
  export const User =() = >
   const Login =true;
    return Login ?(
        <h1>The User is LogedIn</h1>
    ):(

        <h1>The User is LogedOut</h1>
    )

  

🔆 What is CORS?
